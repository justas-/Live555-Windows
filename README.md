# Live555 Streaming Media solution for MS Windows / Visual Studio 2017

This repository contains the complete Visual Studio 2017 solution of Live555 Streaming Media. The solution contains a testRTSP client which compiles and works.

The code is based on Live555 Release 2018.07.07.

## The following changes were done:

* Created projects for each part of the Live555 Straming Media
* Created required dependancy references
* Setup the list of the required libraries
* Added compile flags to silence warnings about the unsafe and deprecated functions (**N.B. UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS!!!**)

## TODO

* Fix the includes directory of the test project. Now all files are duplicated!

## License

* Live555 is licensed under the LGPL.
* Any other files (solution files, etc) are Beerware.
